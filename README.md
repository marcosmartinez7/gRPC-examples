gRPC examples and step by step guide of gRPC gateway.

### Goals

1. Create a protocol buffer file to define a greeter service
2. Implement a Java gRPC Server with that specification
3. Implement a Java gRPC Client with that specification
4. Implement a Gateway that handles both gRPC invocations and REST ones.

### Step by step

Import example project. Extracted from https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/tree/master/examples. 

Based on steps from https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java/blob/master/examples/README.md


1. 

Created a hellorsk.proto that defines the Service interface, Messages and the Rest API endpoints.


b. Added the rskServer task to gradle configuration and `applicationDistribution`
c. `mvn compile`
d. `./gradlew installDist`

2.

The previous step will create the classes defined on the proto. Also, it will define the gRPC base service to implement. So the only thing remining is to implement it. 

The implementation is `RSKGreeterGrpc.RSKGreeterImplBase`

Those two classes were autogenerated by gradle tasks. 

Then, i have created a `HelloRskServer`, the gRPC server that exposes the gRPC service. 

To run it:

`./build/install/examples/bin/hello-rsk-server`

3. 

Idem 2, you only need to implement the client. The `HelloRskClient` has a blocking stub to make gRPC calls to `HelloRskServer`

To run it: 

`./build/install/examples/bin/hello-rsk-client`

4.
